	it's 8:42PM
	im starting at Adding a water plane - page 50
	i successfully add water te the scene and took a screenshot
	and then add colliding property to it
	i also add a coin object(from 3d object)
	and then add cylinder collider, and then mess around with it in abit(scaling and adjusting it)
	im at the end of chapter 1 now
	so far i have learned basic Unity primitive and scale tool
	from this chapter i create a scene contain a structure to move around,
	a FPS controllers(first-person camera) that use WASD to move around
	+ water, collider, mesh..
from the book:

	Summary
	
	Congratulations! On reaching this point, you have laid the foundations for a coin
	collection game that will be complete and functional in the next chapter. Here, we've
	seen how to create a Unity project from scratch and populate it with assets, such as
	meshes, textures, and scenes. In addition, we've seen how to create a scene for our
	game and use a range of assets to populate it with useful functionality that ships
	out of the box with the Unity engine, such as water, first-person controllers, and
	environment prototyping assets. In the next chapter, we'll resume work from where
	we ended here by making a coin that is collectible, and establishing a set of rules and
	logic for the game, making it possible to win and lose.
